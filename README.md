# Kusama Governance Proposals (KGPs)

Kusama can change through the will of its stakeholders through the novel on-chain governance mechanism.

For a full introduction to Kusama's tricameral governance model, see the [Kusama Rollout and Governance](https://polkadot.network/kusama-rollout-and-governance/) post.

This repository is one proposed location for discussion on Kusama governance to take place.
